# DevOps Kitchen Workshop

## Welcome to Mahmoud Sharara's DevOps Journey! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is where I document my progress in the **DevOps Kitchen Workshop**, a hands-on learning community focused on practical workshops and labs. These activities help enhance my skills in DevOps tools through a structured, self-paced study.

### ðŸŒŸ About the DevOps Kitchen Workshop ðŸŒŸ

The **DevOps Kitchen Workshop** is a collaborative, open-source community where members craft and complete workshops on various DevOps tools. It's a great place to learn, share knowledge, and grow together in a supportive environment.

### Why I'm Here

I'm excited to dive into this journey to elevate my DevOps skills. Through this workshop, I aim to:

- **Learn AWS Services:** I'll be tackling one AWS service per week, crafting workshops based on what I learn.
- **Contribute to the Community:** As I complete workshops, I'll share my progress and help others in the community.
- **Gain Admin Privileges:** By staying disciplined and completing tasks on time, I'll earn the opportunity to take on more responsibilities within the community.

### My Weekly Progress

I'll be updating this repository with my weekly tasks and what I've learned

Stay tuned as I continue to grow and contribute to the DevOps Kitchen Workshop!

*Let's make great things happen together!*
